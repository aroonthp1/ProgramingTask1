2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/aroonthp1/ProgramingTask1.git

4. Download the code using  "green" Code in the github repository.

5. Run the program: `ProgrammingTask1.py`

## Usage

1. Launch the program.
2. Follow the prompts to input route details and passenger data.
3. The program will calculate and display total happy customers, total unhappy customers, and the happy-to-unhappy customer ratio.
